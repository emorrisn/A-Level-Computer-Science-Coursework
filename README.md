# Game: Soviet Python
In 2020, I undertook the challenge of developing a computer game as part of my A-level computer science coursework. The result was an outstanding achievement, as I earned an A* grade, attributed to the exceptional quality of both the game itself and the accompanying documentation.

## What is the game about?
In this immersive espionage adventure, players step into the shoes of a recruited Soviet spy, thrust into a world of covert operations and intrigue. Assigned by their enigmatic boss, the player embarks on a series of challenging missions, each designed to test and enhance their coding skills.

Unbeknownst to the player, the twist lies in their lack of coding expertise. As the storyline unfolds, the player's objective becomes twofold: not only to successfully accomplish the espionage missions set by the Soviets but also to acquire the essential skill of coding along the way. The game cleverly integrates hacking missions, progressively guiding the player through coding challenges that unravel the secrets of the digital realm.

As the narrative unfolds, players navigate a thrilling dual journey â€“ mastering the art of coding while unveiling the intricate layers of a gripping espionage plot. Will the player emerge as a skilled coder and a successful Soviet spy, or will the challenges prove too daunting? The stakes are high, and the adventure awaits in this unique fusion of espionage and programming prowess.

## Why is this game special?
This game stands out for its distinctive approach to teaching coding skills, offering a truly unique learning experience. Setting itself apart, the game surpasses the constraints of conventional frameworks like PyGame. Instead, it employs a custom-built infrastructure, utilizing its own levels.json file, a sophisticated leveling system, and an interactive user profile mechanism.

Notably, the development of this game unfolded during the challenging times of the COVID era, demonstrating resilience and creativity. It's worth noting that during this period, resources like ChatGPT were not yet available, emphasizing the independent and innovative nature of the project. This game not only breaks new ground in coding education but also serves as a testament to the ingenuity that emerged during a particularly demanding period in our collective history."

## Keep in mind
The primary objective of this game was to serve as a demonstration of coding proficiency and the ability to meticulously document the underlying code. Consequently, it stands as an incomplete project, featuring only a limited number of levels.

From a personal perspective, I had envisioned crafting a custom level editor to seamlessly interact with the levels.json file, allowing for the creation of an expansive array of levels for players to enjoy. Regrettably, time constraints prevented the full realization of this ambition. Despite the incomplete state, the game serves as a testament to the aspiration for further expansion and innovation within the given constraints.
